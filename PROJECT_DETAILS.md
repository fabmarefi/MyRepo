# Project Details

My motivation to create this project it was a desire to create Fuel  Injection System (monopoint) for a 2 stroke engine (1 cylinder, 135cc)
based on speed-density calculation, where I inject to fuel amount using a PWM signal to simplify my software and its complexity

## Core module 
To create this project I choose the Blue Pill dev board because:
- Low cost and easy to found it
- Hardware is powerful, available different communication modules like: I2C, SPI, CAN, USART and another important resourses like timers, AD converters etc
- Development tool to debug and trace software: flash, download, breakpoint debugging, register and memory view, serial wire trace
- Small size and very good design to create external shields using perforated boards (fast prototype)
